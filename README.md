- Be able to view my order history.
- Get feedback while browsing the website, for example with pop ups.
- Be able to get in contact with the person behind the brand.

### Owner goals
As the owner of the page I want:

## Testing

### Bugs
1. Categories not showing the specific products within a category.
This bug was solved by just simply making the category names into lowercase in the admin panel.
2. Remove link not working on the shoppong bag page. According to the terminal, a slash was missing in the 
javascript function url for the remove function. Solved it by adding a slash at the end of the url.
3. When adding > 1 qty of a product to the shopping bag, the subtotal would show the price of only 1 in qty.
4. When changing the form on the login page to crispy form all inner content covered the entire width of the page. 
I decided to not use the crispy form on the allauth pages, not make bug any bigger. Solved by putting the form
inside a column with the width of halv of the page.
5. Webhook 404 error. Webhook key was not exported correctly to my github variables. Solved by setting the variable
and restarting the workspace.
6. Circle image on index page not showing after adding it to S3. Not solved
